## Introduction:

CGCarpentry is a website for a small carpentry business in Dublin and Leitrim. I'm creating a business for the first time and want to showcase my services on my website.

This website was created as the first project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course. It was built using HTML and CSS. I used Gitpod to write the code.
